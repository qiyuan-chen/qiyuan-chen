I am currently a senior undergraduate student majoring in Statistics at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Central China Normal University. Starting from the fall of 2024, I will be pursuing my Ph.D. at the College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, co-supervised by [Prof. Jian Wu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0004274) and [Dr. Xuming Hu](https://xuminghu.github.io/).

My current research interests primarily include: **<span style="color:#8ECFC9">Information Retrieval (IR)</span>** and **<span style="color:#82B0D2">Natural Language Processing (NLP)</span>** based on LLMs; **<span style="color:#FA7F6F">Computer Vision (CV)</span>** and **<span style="color:#FFBE7A">Multi-Modality (MM)</span>**, and their applications in medicine. Specifically,

* Automated fact-checking (especially fact-checking large language models)
* Low-resource and open-world information extraction
* Language driven semantic segmentation in medicine
* Theory and methods in semi-supervised learning

**Feel free to contact me if your research lies within these or related areas!**

In my free time, I really enjoy developing interesting websites and tools using [Java](https://www.java.com/) (sometimes Python with [Flask](https://flask.net.cn/)) and [Vue.js](https://cn.vuejs.org/). You can check out my projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/qiyuan-chen) if you're interested.
