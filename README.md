**Aspiring to be an outstanding researcher and a proficient full-stack engineer.**

## 📄 Bio

My name is QiyuanChen (陈启源) and I am currently a senior undergraduate student majoring in Statistics at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Central China Normal University. 

Starting from the fall of 2024, I will be pursuing my Ph.D. at the College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, co-supervised by [Prof. Jian Wu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0004274) and [Dr. Jintai Chen](https://whatashot.github.io/).

## 💻 Research Interests

My current research interests primarily include: **<span style="color:#8ECFC9">Tabular Data Prediction (TD)</span>** and **<span style="color:#82B0D2">Semi-Supervised Learning (SS)</span>**. Also I really interested in **<span style="color:#FA7F6F">Natural Language Processing (NLP)</span>** based on LLMs. Specifically,

* Neural Networks for Tabular Data
* Theory and Methods in Semi-Supervised Learning
* Retrieval Augmented Language Models (RALMs)
* Applications of AI (especially LLMs) in Finance

**Feel free to contact me if your research lies within these or related areas!**


## 🏸 More Information

In my free time, I really enjoy developing interesting websites and tools using Java (sometimes Python with Flask) and Vue.js. You can check out my projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/qiyuan-chen) if you're interested. 

I also enjoy digital devices (mechanical keyboards/NAS, etc.), badminton and chess in my spare time.
