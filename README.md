# 👋 Welcome to my Github!

**Aspiring to be an outstanding researcher and a proficient full-stack engineer.**

## 📄 Bio

My name is QiyuanChen (陈启源) and I am currently a senior undergraduate student majoring in Statistics at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Central China Normal University. 

Starting from the fall of 2024, I will be pursuing my Ph.D. at the College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, co-supervised by [Prof. Jian Wu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0004274) and [Dr. Xuming Hu](https://xuminghu.github.io/).

## 💻 Research Interests

My current research interests primarily include: **<span style="color:#8ECFC9">Information Retrieval (IR)</span>** and **<span style="color:#82B0D2">Natural Language Processing (NLP)</span>** based on LLMs. Also I really interested in theory and methods in **<span style="color:#FA7F6F">Semi-Supervised Learning (SS)</span>**. Specifically,

* Automated Fact-Checking (especially fact-checking in LLMs)
* Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in LLMs and its applications
* Sample Selection problem in Semi-Supervised Learning Scenario
* Semi-Supervised Object Detection (SSOD)

**Feel free to contact me if your research lies within these or related areas!**


## 🏸 More Information

In my free time, I really enjoy developing interesting websites and tools using Java (sometimes Python with Flask) and Vue.js. You can check out my projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/qiyuan-chen) if you're interested. 

I also enjoy digital devices (mechanical keyboards/NAS, etc.), badminton and chess in my spare time.
