# üëã Welcome to my Github!

**Aspiring to be an outstanding researcher and a proficient full-stack engineer.**

## üìÑ Bio

My name is Qiyuan Chen (ÈôàÂêØÊ∫ê) and I am currently a Ph.D. student at the College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, co-supervised by [Prof. Jian Wu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0004274) and [Dr. Jintai Chen](https://whatashot.github.io/). Before that, I got my B.Sc. degree from the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Central China Normal University, under the guidance of [Prof. Bo Li](http://maths.ccnu.edu.cn/info/1040/18436.htm) and [Dr. Haitong Yang](http://cs.ccnu.edu.cn/info/1158/2237.htm).

My current research interests primarily include: **<span style="color:#8ECFC9">Multi Modal Learning (MM)</span>**, **<span style="color:#82B0D2">Machine Learning (ML)</span>** and **<span style="color:#FA7F6F">Natural Language Processing (NLP)</span>**. Specifically,

* Multi Modal Learning and its Applications in Medical
* Theories and Methods in Semi-Supervised Learning
* Tabular Data Prediction and Tabular Reasoning
* Modules and Further Applications in RAG systems

**Feel free to contact me if your research lies within these or related areas!**

And I work really closely with [Qian Shao](https://abeier87.github.io/), [Xuming Hu](https://xuminghu.github.io/), [Hongsen Huang](https://github.com/SirlyDreamer) and [Zepeng Li](https://lzzppp.github.io/).

In my free time, I really enjoy developing interesting websites and tools using Java (sometimes Python with FastAPI) and Vue.js. You can check out my projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/qiyuan-chen) if you're interested.

I also enjoy digital devices (mechanical keyboards/NAS, etc.), badminton and chess in my spare time.
